# My Developer Blog

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Repository Description

This repository hosts a developer blog built with Docusaurus. It includes tools and scripts for creating, managing, and deploying static web content. The software supports rapid local development, customizable theming, and seamless deployment to platforms like GitHub Pages or NGINX.

## V-Server connection via ssk-key

1. - Get a server

2. - Generate an SSH key on your PC:
   ```
   $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
   ```

3. - Log in to your V-Server and copy the key:
   ```
   $ ssh-copy-id -i <path to your ssh-key.pub on your pc> <server-user>@<server-name>
   ```
   The console should print: `Number of key(s) added: 1`
   Make sure the path to your public key is correct.

4. - Connect to your V-Server:
   ```
   $ ssh -i <path to ssh-key (not .pub) on your pc> <server-user>@<server-name>
   ```
   ### Disable Password-Login (optional)

   In this section information about disabling password based logins will be provided.
   Passwords can be a source of error potential which is why password logins should be disabled in favor of authenticating via SSH-Keys. ðŸ’¡

   1. Adjust the configuration under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
   1. Find and edit the line `#PasswordAuthentication yes` to that `PasswordAuthentication no`.
   1. Save the file and exit
   1. Restart the `sshd` service to reload the config changes

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (package manager for faster and more efficient dependency handling)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (only required if [deploying using NGINX](#deploying-using-nginx))

1. Installation

   ```
   $ pnpm install
   ```

2. Local Development

   ```
   $ pnpm start
   ```

   This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

3. Build

   ```
   $ pnpm build
   ```

   This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

4. Deployment

   In order to deploy onto Github Pages, ensure that your `docusaurus.config.ts` conforms with the [documentation guidelines](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#deploying-to-github-pages). After that is ensured run the following command to deploy:

   ```
   $ USE_SSH=true pnpm deploy
   ```

For detailed information about deploying this Docusaurus project, refer to the [Deployment](#deployment) section below.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `blog/`: Contains markdown files for blog posts. Blog-related metadata is automatically picked up by the Docusaurus configuration.
- `docs/`: Contains markdown files for documentation. These files are referenced in `sidebars.ts` to define the sidebar structure.
- `src/`: Contains custom React components, CSS, and JavaScript for additional functionality or theming.
- `static/`: Stores static assets (e.g., images, icons) served directly without processing.
- `sidebars.ts`: Configures the structure of sidebars in the documentation section.
- `docusaurus.config.ts`: Main configuration file for customizing and managing Docusaurus behavior.
- `build/`: Generated after running the `pnpm build` command. Contains the static website files ready for deployment.

New content can be added as follows:

- Add new documentation files to the `docs/` folder.
- Add new blog posts to the `blog/` folder. No additional configuration is required.

## Deployment

### Deploy to Github Pages

To deploy using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true pnpm deploy
```

To deploy without using SSH, run:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> pnpm deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

### Deploying using NGINX

To deploy the site using NGINX and Docker, follow this [guide](./docs/guides/deploy-docusaurus-with-docker-and-nginx.md)
